# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the SpotOn Haxe SDK project. The solution will automatically run tests on every push, enforce test requirements for pull requests, and provide detailed feedback on test results and coverage.

## Architecture

The CI/CD system consists of three main components:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Defines the automated build and test process
2. **Branch Protection Rules** - Enforces requirements for merging code
3. **Status Reporting** - Provides feedback on test results and coverage

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push Events**: Triggered on pushes to any branch
- **Pull Request Events**: Triggered when PRs are opened, updated, or synchronized
- **Manual Dispatch**: Allows manual triggering for debugging

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow File

**Location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Key Sections**:
- Job matrix for multiple Haxe versions (4.2.x, 4.3.x)
- Dependency caching strategy
- Test execution and result reporting
- Artifact collection for failed builds

### Haxe Environment Setup

**Haxe Installation**:
- Use `krdlab/setup-haxe` action for consistent Haxe installation
- Install specific versions: 4.2.5 and 4.3.4 (latest stable)
- Configure haxelib for dependency management

**Dependencies**:
- Cache haxelib dependencies using GitHub Actions cache
- Install required libraries: `haxe-concurrent`, `utest`
- Use cache key based on `haxelib.json` content hash

### Test Execution Strategy

**Build Process**:
1. Compile test suite using `build-test.hxml`
2. Execute tests using Neko target
3. Capture test output and results
4. Generate JUnit XML for GitHub integration

**Test Reporting**:
- Use `dorny/test-reporter` action for enhanced test result display
- Generate test coverage reports using built-in Haxe coverage tools
- Upload test artifacts for failed builds

### Branch Protection Configuration

**Main Branch Protection**:
- Require pull requests for all changes
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Allow administrators to bypass restrictions

**Status Checks**:
- `CI / test (4.2.x)` - Tests on Haxe 4.2.x
- `CI / test (4.3.x)` - Tests on Haxe 4.3.x
- Both checks must pass for merge approval

## Data Models

### Workflow Configuration Schema

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        haxe-version: [4.2.5, 4.3.4]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: krdlab/setup-haxe@v1
        with:
          haxe-version: ${{ matrix.haxe-version }}
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.haxelib
          key: haxelib-${{ hashFiles('haxelib.json') }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: haxelib install --always
      - name: Run tests
        run: haxe build-test.hxml
```

### Test Result Schema

```json
{
  "testResults": {
    "total": 150,
    "passed": 148,
    "failed": 2,
    "skipped": 0,
    "duration": "12.5s"
  },
  "coverage": {
    "lines": 85.2,
    "functions": 92.1,
    "branches": 78.9
  },
  "failedTests": [
    {
      "name": "TestClassName.testMethodName",
      "error": "AssertionError: Expected 'expected' but got 'actual'",
      "stackTrace": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Build Failures

**Compilation Errors**:
- Capture Haxe compiler output
- Display syntax errors and type errors clearly
- Provide file and line number information

**Test Failures**:
- Show detailed assertion failures
- Include stack traces for debugging
- Group failures by test class/module

**Infrastructure Failures**:
- Retry transient network failures
- Fallback to alternative package sources
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

### Notification Strategy

**Success Notifications**:
- Green checkmark on commits and PRs
- Summary of test results in PR comments
- Coverage change indicators

**Failure Notifications**:
- Red X on commits and PRs
- Detailed error information in PR comments
- Links to full build logs

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow Testing

**Local Testing**:
- Use `act` tool to run GitHub Actions locally
- Test workflow changes before committing
- Validate caching behavior and dependency installation

**Staging Testing**:
- Test on feature branches before merging
- Verify branch protection rules work correctly
- Ensure status checks integrate properly

### Integration Testing

**End-to-End Scenarios**:
1. Push to feature branch → Tests run → Results displayed
2. Create PR → Tests run → Status checks appear
3. Tests fail → PR blocked → Fix and retry
4. Tests pass → PR mergeable → Merge successful

**Edge Cases**:
- Network failures during dependency installation
- Haxe version compatibility issues
- Large test suites with long execution times
- Concurrent builds from multiple contributors

### Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache haxelib dependencies by `haxelib.json` hash
- Cache Haxe compiler installation
- Use incremental builds when possible

**Parallel Execution**:
- Run different Haxe versions in parallel
- Optimize test execution order
- Use GitHub Actions concurrency controls

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

**API Keys**:
- No external API keys required for basic CI
- Use GitHub secrets for any future integrations
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs

**Permissions**:
- Use minimal required permissions for actions
- Restrict write access to protected branches
- Audit action permissions regularly

### Dependency Security

**Supply Chain Security**:
- Pin action versions to specific commits
- Use official Haxe installation methods
- Regularly update dependencies

**Code Scanning**:
- Consider adding CodeQL analysis for security
- Monitor for vulnerable dependencies
- Implement dependency update automation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics Collection

**Build Metrics**:
- Build duration trends
- Success/failure rates
- Cache hit rates
- Test execution times

**Usage Metrics**:
- Number of builds per day/week
- Most common failure types
- Developer adoption of CI practices

### Maintenance Tasks

**Regular Updates**:
- Update Haxe versions as new releases become available
- Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
- Review and update branch protection rules

**Troubleshooting**:
- Monitor build failures and common issues
- Maintain documentation for common problems
- Provide clear error messages and resolution steps
