# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement continuous integration using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push to the repository and require tests to pass before allowing pull requests to be merged. This ensures code quality and prevents broken code from being merged into the main branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically on every push, so that I can quickly identify if my changes break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to any branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a test run
2. WHEN the test run completes THEN the system SHALL display the test results in the GitHub interface
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL mark the commit status as failed with clear error information
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL mark the commit status as successful

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want pull requests to be blocked if tests fail, so that broken code cannot be merged into the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL automatically run the full test suite
2. WHEN tests fail on a pull request THEN the system SHALL prevent the pull request from being merged
3. WHEN tests pass on a pull request THEN the system SHALL allow the pull request to be merged
4. WHEN a pull request is updated with new commits THEN the system SHALL re-run tests automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI system to test against multiple Haxe versions, so that I can ensure compatibility across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL test against Haxe 4.2.x and 4.3.x versions
2. WHEN any supported Haxe version fails THEN the system SHALL mark the overall build as failed
3. WHEN all supported Haxe versions pass THEN the system SHALL mark the overall build as successful

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see test results and coverage information, so that I can understand what tests ran and their outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of passed/failed tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages and stack traces
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL generate and display test coverage metrics
4. WHEN viewing a pull request THEN the system SHALL show test status badges and links to detailed results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to configure branch protection rules, so that the main branch is protected from direct pushes and requires passing tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN branch protection is enabled THEN the system SHALL require pull requests for all changes to main branch
2. WHEN branch protection is enabled THEN the system SHALL require status checks to pass before merging
3. WHEN branch protection is enabled THEN the system SHALL require up-to-date branches before merging
4. IF an administrator needs to override THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to bypass protection rules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI system to cache dependencies, so that builds run faster and don't repeatedly download the same packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build runs THEN the system SHALL cache Haxe compiler and haxelib dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies haven't changed THEN the system SHALL reuse cached dependencies
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL update the cache with new dependencies
4. WHEN cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh cached dependencies
