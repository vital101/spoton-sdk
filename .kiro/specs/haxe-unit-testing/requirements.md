# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement comprehensive unit testing for the SpotOn SDK Haxe project. The testing framework will focus exclusively on testing the Haxe source code without testing the generated target language outputs (PHP, Python, Node.js). The implementation will leverage the existing `utest` dependency to create a robust testing infrastructure that ensures code quality and reliability across all SDK components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the SpotOn SDK, I want a comprehensive unit testing framework, so that I can ensure code quality and catch regressions early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests for Haxe source code only
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail results with detailed output
3. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and stack traces
4. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0
5. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL exit with a non-zero status code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test all core SDK components, so that I can verify the functionality of authentication, HTTP requests, models, and utilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication components THEN the system SHALL verify token handling and validation logic
2. WHEN testing HTTP components THEN the system SHALL verify request building and response parsing
3. WHEN testing model components THEN the system SHALL verify data serialization and deserialization
4. WHEN testing utility components THEN the system SHALL verify helper functions and data transformations
5. WHEN testing the main client THEN the system SHALL verify initialization and configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy test execution and integration, so that I can run tests efficiently during development and in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL provide a single command to run all tests
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL include a separate build configuration for tests
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete within a reasonable time frame
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing build configurations
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of test results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized test structure, so that I can easily locate and maintain tests for specific components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL mirror the source code directory structure
2. WHEN creating test files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN adding new tests THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the test suite
4. WHEN viewing test files THEN the system SHALL clearly identify which source code they test
5. WHEN maintaining tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between test categories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock and stub capabilities, so that I can test components in isolation without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing HTTP components THEN the system SHALL provide mock HTTP responses
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide mock authentication tokens
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide stub implementations for external services
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL not make actual HTTP requests to external APIs
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL simulate various error conditions
