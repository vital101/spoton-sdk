# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive SDK for SpotOn's Central API using the Haxe programming language. The SDK will be designed to compile to three target platforms: PHP, Python, and Node.js, providing developers with a unified interface to interact with SpotOn's API across multiple programming environments. The SDK will leverage Haxe's cross-platform capabilities and native libraries to ensure consistent functionality across all target languages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using PHP, I want to integrate SpotOn's API into my application, so that I can access SpotOn's services without writing custom HTTP client code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SDK is compiled to PHP THEN it SHALL provide all core API functionality available in the SpotOn Central API
2. WHEN a PHP developer imports the SDK THEN they SHALL be able to authenticate with SpotOn's API using provided credentials
3. WHEN API calls are made through the PHP SDK THEN they SHALL return properly typed response objects
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the PHP SDK SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using Python, I want to integrate SpotOn's API into my application, so that I can access SpotOn's services using Python-native patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SDK is compiled to Python THEN it SHALL provide all core API functionality available in the SpotOn Central API
2. WHEN a Python developer imports the SDK THEN they SHALL be able to authenticate with SpotOn's API using provided credentials
3. WHEN API calls are made through the Python SDK THEN they SHALL return properly typed response objects following Python conventions
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the Python SDK SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using Node.js, I want to integrate SpotOn's API into my application, so that I can access SpotOn's services using JavaScript/TypeScript patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SDK is compiled to Node.js THEN it SHALL provide all core API functionality available in the SpotOn Central API
2. WHEN a Node.js developer imports the SDK THEN they SHALL be able to authenticate with SpotOn's API using provided credentials
3. WHEN API calls are made through the Node.js SDK THEN they SHALL return properly typed response objects or Promises
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the Node.js SDK SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using any target platform, I want consistent API method signatures and behavior, so that I can easily switch between platforms or maintain code across multiple environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same API method is called across different target platforms THEN it SHALL have identical method signatures
2. WHEN the same API endpoint is accessed across platforms THEN it SHALL return equivalent data structures
3. WHEN authentication is performed across platforms THEN it SHALL use the same credential format and process
4. WHEN errors occur across platforms THEN they SHALL be represented consistently with the same error codes and messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK to handle SpotOn API authentication automatically, so that I don't need to manually manage tokens and authentication headers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API credentials are provided to the SDK THEN it SHALL automatically handle authentication token retrieval
2. WHEN an authentication token expires THEN the SDK SHALL automatically refresh it without user intervention
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the SDK SHALL throw a clear authentication error with actionable information
4. IF multiple API calls are made concurrently THEN the SDK SHALL handle token management thread-safely

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage of SpotOn's Central API endpoints, so that I can access all available functionality through the SDK.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SpotOn Central API documentation is reviewed THEN the SDK SHALL implement all documented endpoints
2. WHEN new endpoints are added to SpotOn's API THEN the SDK architecture SHALL support easy addition of new endpoints
3. WHEN API parameters are required THEN the SDK SHALL validate them before making requests
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the SDK SHALL parse them into strongly-typed objects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging capabilities, so that I can debug issues and handle failures gracefully in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail due to network issues THEN the SDK SHALL throw network-specific exceptions
2. WHEN API calls return error responses THEN the SDK SHALL throw API-specific exceptions with error details
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the SDK SHALL log request and response details
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the SDK SHALL provide clear rate limit exception information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SDK to use Haxe native libraries where possible, so that the compiled output is efficient and maintains consistent behavior across target platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN the SDK SHALL use Haxe's native HTTP libraries that compile to target-appropriate implementations
2. WHEN JSON parsing is required THEN the SDK SHALL use Haxe's native JSON libraries
3. WHEN date/time handling is needed THEN the SDK SHALL use Haxe's native Date class
4. WHEN string manipulation is performed THEN the SDK SHALL use Haxe's native string operations
