# Test Fixtures

This directory contains JSON fixture files and test data for the SpotOn SDK unit tests.

## Structure

- `api_responses/` - Sample API response JSON files
- `test_data/` - Reusable test data objects and builders
- `auth/` - Authentication-related test data (tokens, credentials)
- `config/` - Test configuration files

## Usage

Fixtures are used by test classes to provide consistent, realistic test data without making actual API calls.
